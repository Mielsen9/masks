          <p>
            The N95 mask is a form of respiratory protective wear worn over
            the nose and mouth to help minimise the chance of inhaling
            airborne particles like viruses and other germs. It is a disposable
            mask made from synthetic polymer fibres produced in a highly
            specialised process called melt blowing. During this process,
            the inner layer of the N95 mask is created which forms the
            filtration layer capable of filtering out at least 95% of
            airborne particles when worn correctly.

            <br>
            During outbreaks of respiratory illnesses and during periods
            of intense air pollution, wearing N95 masks has been shown to
            help reduce the inhalation of compromised air, filtering out
            nasty pathogens which lead to illness or which can aggravate
            existing respiratory problems. Maintaining clear and unhindered
            respiration is vitally important for remaining fit and healthy
            and people with pre-existing conditions or respiratory fragility
            can particularly benefit from wearing face masks while they are
            out in public and unable to control the breathing environments
            that they find themselves in.

          <h5 class="about__title title-2">N95 Respirators In Industrial And Health Care Settings</h5>
          <p>
            Most N95 respirators are manufactured for use in construction
            and other industrial type jobs that expose workers to dust and
            small particles. They are regulated by the National Personal
            Protective Technology Laboratory (NPPTL) in the National Institute
            for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH), which is part of the
            Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).
            <br>
            <br>
            However, some N95 respirators are intended for use in a health
            care setting. Specifically, single-use, disposable respiratory
            protective devices used and worn by health care personnel during
            procedures to protect both the patient and health care personnel
            from the transfer of microorganisms, body fluids, and particulate
            material. These surgical N95 respirators are class II devices
            regulated by the FDA, under 21 CFR 878.4040, and CDC NIOSH under
            42 CFR Part 84.
